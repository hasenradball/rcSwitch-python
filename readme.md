# rcSwitch-python

rcSwitch-python is a python based script to switch remote controled sockets via 433 MHz.

This script is based on the following libraries:
- rpi-rf
- RPI.GPPIO

## Necessary Hardware
- Raspberry Pi or any other board having digital GPIO</br>

- 433 MHz transmitter (for sending -> send device)</br>

- 433 MHz controlled power socket, e.g. Brennenstuhl RCS 1000 N</br>

## Setting up the Hardware
Connect the `VCC-Pin` of the 433 MHz transmitter to any 5 V output pin of your board.</br>
The `GND-Pin` to a ground pin.</br>
And the `ATAD-Pin` to any `GPIO` pin.</br>
In this example, pin 17 is used.

It is recommened to connect a (long) cable to the ANT pin of the 433 Mhz transmitter - this extends the range of the sender.

### Setup the Socket Device
To define the relevant Codes you have to set the dip switches in the socket.

## 1.) Installation of this Library
To install this labrary you need to run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/hasenradball/rcSwitch-python.git
git checkout develop
```


## 2.) Installation of dependencies
Make sure that you have the latest packages on the Pi.

Do an update:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
Also make sure that you have installed the `rpi-rf` library.

```
python -m pip install rpi-rf
```
Optional:

- to be sure that the library is also available for `root` user, do this:

``` 
sudo -i
python -m pip install rpi-rf
exit
```
Then  you should make sure that the current `user` is in the `group` of the the `gpio` users.

```
sudo usermod -a -G gpio $USER
```
If you have dose this steps, then you should be able to switch the sockets now.

## Usage
to Switch the socket you ca do it for example via `cli` like:

```
python3 switchSocket SystemCode ButtonCode status
```
Alternative you can do it like this:

```
python3 switchSocket SystemCode A status
```
or this way:

```
python3 switchSocket SystemCode 16 status
```
Where the following correlations for the `ButtonCode` can be described:

|Letter|int|binary|
|------|---|------|
| A / a| 16| 10000|
| B / b|  8| 01000|
| C / c|  4| 00100|
| D / d|  2| 00010|
| E / e|  1| 00001|

## Further information

## Error Handling
If you get an Error like:</br>
>RuntimeError: No access to /dev/mem.  Try running as root!

The user does not belong to the Group of `gpio`.
Try to run with `sudo`.
